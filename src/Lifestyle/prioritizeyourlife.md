# Balancing a Busy Life
There are a lot of different philosophies to increase productivity, reduce wasted time, remove destractions, etc. The list goes on. I've read books such as [Getting Things Done: The Art of Stress-Free Productivity](https://www.amazon.com/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-Free-Productivity/dp/0142000280), [Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience](https://www.amazon.com/Flow-Psychology-Experience-Perennial-Classics/dp/0061339202), [First Things First](https://www.amazon.com/First-Things-Stephen-R-Covey/dp/0684802031) (As of writing this I am about half way through the book). I have watched videos and listened to philosophies from Minimalists, such as [Matt D'Avella](https://www.youtube.com/user/blackboxfilmcompany), from hardcore 'get it done' people like [Jocko Willink](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkqcY4CAuBFNFho6JgygCnA), and even light hearted school survival guides, such as [Mariana's Study Corner](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEHp_b02I0GvTYCBPX_0w1g). 

From all of these, I have nitpicked a lot of the philosophies and strategies that I use today to balance a busy lifestyle. This is something I started building during college as a best practice for myself, so take this reading with a grain of salt because best practices for this is not a "one size fits all". In fact, the reason I am writing this is to self-reflect on this method and make sure it is still a best practice for myself. Because as we grow we change, and as we change we need to adapt. 

# Overview
As I mentioned in the introduction, a lot of my ideas are not original. A lot of the way I schedule and prioritize myself is accredited to others' ideas and philosophies. It is as that saying goes:
> Only a fool learns from his own mistakes. The wise man learns from the mistakes of others. - Otto von Bismarck

While reading through this, don't forget you are your own person. Start slow, or implement everything at once. It is whatever makes it easy for **you**. The important part is that you are disciplined and commit to what you decide to do/try. Along with that, if something seems obvious while reading this, skip it. It is a bunch of separate ideas compounded into a single workflow. Read what is new/interesting to you. The whole point of this post is to be open and honest with yourself. Which depending on where you are in life can be stupid easy or crippling difficult. 

As for the orginization of the post, I go through philosophies and ideas in the first couple sections. Implementation is discussed in the "Make it Accessible" section. 

<!-- * May sound like a lot of other's, because like I said it is nitpicked
* Start now, or slowly start incorporating things into your life (depends on you)
	* What you do need is discipline to commit to what you decide to do
* Skim what seems obvious, ponder what doesn't
* Depending on who and where you are in life, this process can be either stupid easy, or crippling hard.
* Talking philosophy, "Make it Accessible" section talks about implementation -->

# Develop your Priority
It is hard to enjoy the journey when there is no direction. Maybe initially it is, but it's like summer break. It is great for a while, but you soon find yourself bored in the basement trying to find something to do, and when school inevitably comes back it is a bitter sweet feeling. Maybe that is just me. At any rate, there is more to this section than being bored in your basement. It is about finding your direction in life. It isn't just what you want to be when you grow up, it is about who you want to be, the kind of relationships you want to have, the state of mind you want to be in, etc. 

Days are so compact with distractions and urgent (yet non-vital) things that we forget ourselves. We can never 100% schedule our days to directly affect us achieving our goals, but we can at the very least find *some* time for what is important to us even on the worst of days. It isn't all about living efficiently, its about living intentionally first. The prior will come later.

Just as in every book that talks about living intentional lives goes, they give the example of the big rock, medium rock, little rock, water example. Imagine yourself a bucket. You initially fill it up with large rocks. Would you say it is full? Well what if I were to pour gravel in it next, is it full now? Well what about sand? What about some water? The point being, if you proritize the big rocks (what your priority action items are), the smaller stuff will fill out the spaces. You still can get the busy work out of the way while still achieving what is important to you on a daily basis even if it is with bite sized chunks.

<!--- * Build what is important to you
* Build a life that revolves around what is important to you
* Big rock, little, rock, sand, water analogy --> 

## Create a "Personal Statement"
The first stepping stone is the so called "Personal Statement". The name has been tossed around and seems to be the most common terminology. It isn't my favorite, but we will roll with it. Essentially, this is a small piece of writing to your self, by your self, for your self. Take time to reflect on how things are now. Are you happy? How are your relationships? Do you feel fulfulled? Juxtapose what is reality and what is desired. *First Things First* creates a framework of what kind of questions you should be asking by identifying four basic needs:
* The need to live: The basics to survive such as food, water, and shelter.
* The need to love: To love and to be loved.
* The need to learn: Out mental need to develop and grow.
* The need to leave a legacy: Sprititual need to have a sense of meaning, purpose, and contribution.

You don't need to follow these to the letter, use them as a catalyst to spark ideas. It is easier to start when you don't have to invent the wheel. 

Even still, you will most likely get stuck aswering these questions. Think of who/what inspires you or who/what motivates you. Emulating what someone else has done isn't a bad thing. You may not necessarily be able to be your own person 100% of the time because you don't know who you really are, how you want something done, or how you want things to be. Doing **something** is better than nothing at all and will eventually hone in on who you are.

Lastly, it does not have to be a novel. It can be, but it doesn't have to be. It doesn't even have to be in paragraph form. Put down what makes sense and roll with it. This isn't going to be the last time you visit this (if you are doing it right at least). My big revisit comes annualy and comes in the form of a Scrum like retrospective, but more on that later.

<!--- * "What/Who do you want to be when you grow up"
* Who inspires you
* What motivates you
* What relationships are important to you
* This doesn't need to be a novel, or even written down as a matter of fact. I've come to find that as I self reflect, I know who I am and who I want to be. So in a way, my "personal statement" is what comes up as a yes/no gut reaction becaues I reflect just about every day unitentionally. --> 

## Create a List
Now that you have a Personal Statement, now we need to disect it. Group and categorize your aspirations/desires into roles. Such as personal, work, school, hobby, etc. These are the rolls you play day-to-day. For each role, list your goals. They do not need to be quantitative, but they should be tangible (can you feel it now Mr. Krabs?). They also don't have to be "anything", it is personal to you. What do you feel like has been missing, lacking, needs attention, and most importantly what have you been avoiding?

Again, it does not matter if this section gets messy. Right now we are drafting. Besides, this is a skill in it of itself, it gets easier with time as you come to know yourself. Even still, not all the ideas will come to us immediately. Sometimes you need to sit down a few times to get something that feels right (for both the personal statment and this. As a matter of fact, just about everything in this post). 

Some of the things we should be writing down are the subtle things that slip our mind during the day. For myself, it is difficult to identify and state how I would like to better my relationships. Sometimes they come fleeting by as minor feelings of "Maybe I should have said hi or reached out". Things like that should be noted because they aren't curated, they come naturally from within us. So, if you are feeling that naturally it may be something that you feel is need of attention.

<!-- * List your roles
* List your goals for each of those roles
	* Personal, student, work, hobby, etc.
	* They do not need to be quantitative, but they do need to be tangible (can you feel it Mr. Krabs?)
	* They don't have to be "anything", they need to be what is personal to you. What do you feel like has been missing, lacking, needs attention, and most importantly what have you been avoiding. 
* Doesn't matter if it is messy, this isn't the final product.
* Doesn't have to happen in a single sitting, sometimes things come to you later. This is a on-going process.
* List the obvious, list the not so obvious, and list those fleeting ideas.
	* "Maybe I should have said hi"
	* "Maybe I should have called Mom"
	* "Maybe I should have worked on that project today" -->
	
## Analyze/Prioritize that List
Okay, we probably have a massive list of just stuff jotted down. If you don't that's okay too. The point is that the creative juices have started flowing, we have the right mindset, and a bunch of things in front ofus that we can analyze one at at time.

First things first, identify what matches you personal statement and what does not. If it doesn't, it is not a priority and can be tossed out. After we took out what isn't a priority, it is important to identify properties of the items. How urgent is it? Does it need to be repeatively done every day, week, month? Is it something you have been putting off?

While going through this process, don't forget about "sharpening the knife" items. These items are things such as exersizing, reading, and personal projects that don't necessarily add to productivity immediately, but is benefitial long term. It is extremely easy to get caught in all the "urgent" things which cause you to spin you wheels. It isn't always about what is now, it is important about who and where you want to be.

Now that you have gone through everything, reanalyze the list again. What *really* matches your personal statement? What *really* needs to be done now? What *really* needs to be done every week/every day? 

Again, don't get caught in all things that *look* urgent. A lot are not. A good way of identifying if these items work toward in favor of your poersonal statement is if your items on your list don't work together to meet your goal. If they don't, maybe you need to rethink your list. If you can't rethink your list, think about your mentality toward the item. If it is not directly impacting you, maybe it is indirectly. If you have an item that you **have** to do there are ways to spin it to your benefit, but your benefit isn't always **just** your benefit. Working a bad job is not directly beneficial, but it is experience, an income, and it maybe provide for loved ones, etc. Sometimes it is just takes a shift of mindset.

<!---
* What matches your personal statment, what doesn't.
* What needs to be done now
* What needs to be done every week/every day
* Where do you want to be
* What is ignored
* Don't get caught in all the urgent things, you can't do anything effectively if you don't work on yourself
	* Time for yourself and for your relationships are *necessary*.
* Reflect on each item, the bigger it is the more time it may take. If it is big, you need to know that is for you. Take your time before you take a plunge you weren't ready for.
## Analyze/Prioritize that List Again
* What *really* matches your personal statment, what doesn't.
* What *really* needs to be done now
* What *really* needs to be done every week/every day
* Where do you *really* want to be
* What *really* is ignored
* Don't get caught in all things that *look* urgent. A lot are not.
* If your items on your list don't work together to meet your goal, rethink your list.
	* If you can't rethink your list, think about your mentality toward the item. If it is not directly impacting you, maybe it is indirectly. 
	* Spin it to your benefit, but your benefit isn't always **just** your benefit. 
		* Working with people you don't like that much
		* Working a bad job, but it is a job
		* Sometimes all it takes is a change in mindset
		* Think "Why"?
* Rate them in terms of what **needs** to be done now, what has to be done, __**and**__ what **you** need to do every day/week to grow. If it doesn't point toward your dream or "personal statement", you are doing it wrong. --->
	
# Organize It
With the hard part done, it is time to take all this disorganized brainstorming and put it in an organized way that we can manage in our workflow and make your hard work come to fruition. The way that I approach it is in a meta-scrum like way. I have a yearly, monthly, weekly, and daily plan/review. The reason I do this is to make sure I am constantly asking myself if what I am doing is working towards my personal statement and whether I should refine it or not. It gives me the chance to view it in a micro and macro way every day/week/month/year. Let's talk about how I approach this. 

With the list of ideas that you have brainstormed ask yourself, "Where do I want to be in a year?". With that question, you have the ball rolling. In my experience, imagining myself where I want to be in a year is a hell of a lot easier than asking myself what I want to be before I die. Then break that down into what you can do in a month, in a week, then in a day. This is forcing you to break down tasks in to actionable items which we can act upon as described in [Getting Things Done: The Art of Stress-Free Productivity](https://www.amazon.com/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-Free-Productivity/dp/0142000280). 

Keep in mine though, you don't need to be physically in a different place, different job, or different home. It can be something like a habit such as the 2Day Rule that I have been trying to implement myself. Basically it is a rule that says that I can't take a break off something for more than two days in a row. Its a work ethic that I want to have. Such as with my workouts, I won't go two days without a workout unless something comes up that I can't. Another example is having a better attitude at work just for the sake of trying to have a better quality of life while on the job even if you don't like the job. 

Another **very** important thing to remember is keep things realistic for yourself. If you haven't been to the gym in years, don't plan on going five times a week. For the first month make it once a week, something so easy that you **can** do it and feed on that momentum in the future. Setting goals that you stop meeting is just going to discourage you to the point where you will forget about it.

Lastly, find a time to keep tabs on all this stuff. I try to look at this once a day and update where I am at and if anything came up that should be added. The best time for me is in the morning at work. I set up what I want to get done that day for work and for the day. 

<!---* Sort of meta-scrum based approach
* Approach:
	* Yearly Review
	* Monthly Review
	* Weekly Review
	* Daily Plan
* Every step you are questioning your personal statement to refine it.
* Doesn't have to be a "thing" 
	* Philosophies (2 Day Rule)
	* Better attitude at work
	* Talking to people
	* Taking initiative
* Make it realistic
* Find a time
	* I take the first few minutes at work or at home in the morning
		* Usually one of the first things I do --->

## Yearly Review
* Take an hour
* Long term 
	* Doesn't have to be only for this year, get it all down
* Goals you *will* achieve (if not, at least you gave it your best shot)
* Bucket List 
	* What would be nice to do
	* Long shot goals that you will try to do, but you will not have the guilt on not doing them
* Reflect
	* Who are you thankful for
	* What did you learn
	* How did you grow
	* What experiences are you thankful for

## Monthly Review
* Take 30 minutes
* What from your yearly review can you get done this month
	* Don't do it all, you have a year
* Something that will make you grow
* Something that will make you uncomfortable 
* Something that will make you happy
* Something that will bring you closer with those you love

## Weekly Review
* Take 15 Minutes
* What from the monthly review can you get done this week
* You don't need to do all of the groups from the monthly review that week
	* Don't do it all, you have a month

## Daily Plan
* Take 5 minutes
* What from the weekly review can you do today
	* Don't do it all you have a week
* This is where you place your known things (meetings, class times, work, etc), get an idea of your free time
	* These things are day-to-day motions that aren't priority (maybe) but have to be done (unless a big rock falls from the sky, such as your girlfriend/wife needs you)
* Place your big rocks
	* spend time with significant other
	* Exersize
	* Work on hobby
* Identify smaller rocks, sand, and water
	* Grocery shopping
	* Doctor's appointment
	* etc.
* Don't have enough time?
	* Refine list
	* Do a small version of your original plan
		* Was going to the gym, but need to go grocery shopping? Do a workout at home.
	* Do it another day
	* Wake up earlier, go to bed later
		* Sometimes everything that is important to you takes a lot of time and you need to make a sacrifice

# Make it Accessible 
* Becausde this is an on-going process it should be accessible anywhere
* If you don't know what to do, you don't have an excuse.
	* You always have something that can refer you to something that can lead you toward your goal
	* If you can't do any of the things currently, at least you can think about that and revise
	* Createive juices lead to other creative juices
* The way I do things
	* Github for Annual, monthly, and weekly retrospectives
		* Show examples of each
		* Paperless
		* Easy to get to from phone, computer, etc.
		* Part of my morning routine at work
	* Google calendar for daily
		* Access via app
		* Calendar blocking
			* Show exmaple
			* Does not need to be **exact** in time nor when it is done. 
				* Take your best guess and use it as a template to visualize your day and how long things will take to make better judgement for what is realistic for you today.
				* Don't pack your day, over estimate your time. You can always add to your day.
				
# Conclusion
