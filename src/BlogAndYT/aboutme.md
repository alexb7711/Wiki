# About Me
## How to write an "About Me" page
1. What value do you give your audience?

* School tips
* Balancing work and life
* Real world thoughts
* Insights into creating/finding projects
* Insights into what it is like working through a project

2. Who is my blog/videos for?

* People looking to go into programming
* People who want to do side projects outside of work/school
* School/Work advice and thoughts

3. Your Site's BIO

* Why should someone read your blog? Try a sentence like, “If you love X, X, and X, you’ll feel right at home here.”
    * If you want to make a living of being an engineer/programmer and don't know what to do, what it is like, or where to start; this is a good start for you.
* What will they get out of your posts? Are they going to get fashion inspiration? Business advice? An encouraging community of supportive women? Let ’em know what they can expect.
    * Tutorials, learning experiences, advice for going into the field.
* Which types of posts do you write? Do you have any awesome series that people should know about? Where should they start?
    * Posts will either be a continuing series of projects and lessons. A lot of them will be self contained ideas that are gathered from life events.
* Why does your blog have credibility? This one is pretty flexible. You could list the big-name sites your content has been shared on, talk about how you have X years of experience in a particular field, OR you can let your readers know that you’re still learning, too, but love to share things as you discover them.
    * Bachelors in mechanical engineering with a minor in computer science, works as a computer scientist doing embedded system stuff, and going to get a masters in electrical engineering. 
* How did your site get started? Don’t be afraid to be personable here and incorporate how your site came to be. Did you feel inspired after a certain event in your life? Did your passion for your blog’s topic start back in third grade? Tell a story!
    * I feel like there are a lot of lessons to be learned when trying to dip your toes into so many different things. It not only creates an organized way to keep me thoughts and reflect, I have to be accountable of what I am doing.

4. Your personal BIO

* I am a mechanical engineer major and a computer scientist minor that works as a computer scientist and is planning on getting a masters in computer engineering. 
* Outside of this I enjoy playing soccer, working out, and doing outdoorsy stuff.

5. The biggest thing that most people forget
CALL TO ACTION

## About Me
Engineering is a broad word. It encompass many fields, but it all has an underlying approach. Identify a problem, come up with a flood of ideas to address it, develop the design/architecture, and implementation. We all have a good understanding of that. The difficulty comes when we try to decide what we want to DO with that. So, where does that leave us? 

It can get confusing. You make love computer science or mechanical engineering, but what do you want to DO with it? The DO is the hard question.

In this blog, I talk about all the do's associated with computer science/engineering: 
• Tips and tricks for college
• Personal projects start to finish
• What the day in the life is like 
• How to keep a balanced lifestyle 

My name is Alex Brown, I have a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering with a minor in computer science. I currently work as a computer scientist developing for an embedded environment. I am also currently pursuing a master's in computer engineering.

## About the Blog
We like creating stuff. That is why we are aspiring engineers and/or computer scientists.

The idea of being able to make something out of nothing and understanding **everything** about it is enticing. 

There are things in the creation process that aren't talked about a lot though.

**The Learning Curve**

Not necessarily for the subjects you are learning, but how engineering actually is. 

There is a problem though: it is difficult.

What do I mean by this? Let me demonstrate by example:

You go to school to learn how to be an engineer/computer scientist, but then we are faced with challenges of balancing everything with life, so naturally we try to think of better ways to manage time and more effective ways of approaching school. You also start understanding what you like, and start getting a want to start doing personal projects but don't know what to do, where to start, or even think you have the time.

Or maybe...

You go to work that you enjoy (or don't), but you have other ideas floating in your head that you would like to have realized. But maybe you don't know where to start, give up too soon, or don't even feel like there is time to start in the first place.

There are a lot of reasons to stop or stagnate, and I personally have. I believe that is part of the learning curve of understanding what it is like as an engineer, because it is hard.

There is also something that can be said about learning from other's mistakes. That is the point of this blog.

I talk about days in the life of being an engineer, things I learned in the field, things I learn during school, showing projects start to finish, and ways I try to balance everything.

If this is something that interests you, feel free to follow the blog for more in depth documentation, or easy to bite YouTube videos.

## My Bio
My name is Alex Brown, I graduated December 2018 with a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering with a minor in computer science. I currently work as a computer scientist developing for an embedded environment. I am also currently am pursuing a master's in computer engineering. 

I found myself going through a lot of ruts while pursuing this career, which inspired all of this. 

I love programming and I love design. I enjoy my job. There is just something else that is missing which I felt could be a good learning experience for others.
