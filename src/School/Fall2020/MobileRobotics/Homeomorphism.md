# Homeomorphism
A homeomorphism (bicontinuous function) is a continuous function between topoligical spaces that has a continuous inverse function. Homeomorphism are the isomorphism (a mapping between two structures of the same type that can be reversed by an inverse mapping) within the topological field. In other words, they are the mappings that preserve all the topological properties of a given space with a continuous map and inverse function.

Wolfram gives a good definition. It is written as follows:
> The most common meaning is possessing intrinsic topological equivalence. Two objects are homeomorphic if they can be deformed into each other by a continuous, invertible mapping. Such a homeomorphism ignores the space in which surfaces are embedded, so the deformation can be completed in a higher dimensional space than the surface was originally embedded. Mirror images are homeomorphic, as are Möbius strip with an even number of half-twists, and Möbius strip with an odd number of half-twists.

An often-repeated mathematical joke is that topologists can't tell the difference between a coffee cup and a donut,[3] since a sufficiently pliable donut could be reshaped to the form of a coffee cup by creating a dimple and progressively enlarging it, while preserving the donut hole in the cup's handle.

# Definition
Verbally, we can define homeomorphism as:

1. Possessing similarity in form
2. Continous, one-to-one, in surjection and having a continous inverse

Mathematically it is written:

A function $f:X \rightarrow Y$ between two topological spaces is a homeomorphism if it has the following properties:

1. $f$ a bijection (one-to-one and onto)
2. $f$ is continuous
3. the inverse function $f^{-1}$ is continuous ($f$ is an open mapping).

A homeomorphism is sometimes called a bicontinuous function. If such a function exists, {\displaystyle X}X and {\displaystyle Y}Y are homeomorphic. A self-homeomorphism is a homeomorphism from a topological space onto itself. "Being homeomorphic" is an equivalence relation on topological spaces. Its equivalence classes are called homeomorphism classes.
