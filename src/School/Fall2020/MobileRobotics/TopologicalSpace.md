# Topological Space
Topological space, in mathematics, generalization of Euclidean spaces in which the idea of closeness, or limits, is described in terms of relationships between sets rather than in terms of distance.

# Euclidean Space
Ancient Greek geometers introduced Euliciean space for modeling the physical universe. The goal was to prove that all properties of the space as theorems by starting from a few fundamental properties (such as the example of there is exactly one straight line passing through two points). Later this was redefined via vector space and linear algebra which has been shown to be the equivalent asxiomatic definition. 

## Definition
Essentially the Euclidean plane is a set of points satisfying certain relationships, expressible in terms of distance and angles. As an example, there are two fundamential operations (otherwise called as motions) on a plane. One is translation and the other rotation about a fixed point in which all the points in the plane turn about that fixed point through the same angle.

### Technical Definition
A Euclidean vector space is a finite-dimensional inner product space over the real numbers. The dimension of a Euclidean space is the dimension of its associated vector space.

The elements of $E$ are called points and are commonly denoted by capital letters. The elements of $\overrightarrow{E}$ are called translations, Euclidean vectors or free vectors.

# Topological Space Properties
Every topoligical space consists of:

1. A set of points
2. A class of subsets defined axiomatically as open sets
3. The set of operations of union and intersection

In addition, (2) must defined in such as way that the intersection of any finite number of open sets is itself open and the union of any collection of open sets is likewise open.

In mathematical terms:
A topological space, also called an abstract topological space, is a set X together with a collection of open subsets T that satisfies the four conditions:

1. The empty set $0$ is in $T$.
2. $X$ is in $T$.
3. The intersection of a finite number of sets in $T$ is also in $T$.
4. The union of an arbitrary number of sets in T is also in T$$.

Alternatively, $T$ may be defined to be the closed sets rather than the open sets, in which case conditions 3 and 4 become:

3. The intersection of an arbitrary number of sets in $T$ is also in $T$.
4. The union of a finite number of sets in $T$ is also in $T$.

Or in other words: 
A topological space is an ordered pair (X, τ), where X is a set and τ is a collection of subsets of X, satisfying the following axioms:[8]

1. The empty set and X itself belong to τ.
2. Any arbitrary (finite or infinite) union of members of τ still belongs to τ.
3. The intersection of any finite number of members of τ still belongs to τ.

The elements of τ are called open sets and the collection τ is called a topology on X.
