# Topological Space
Topological space, in mathematics, generalization of Euclidean spaces in which the idea of closeness, or limits, is described in terms of relationships between sets rather than in terms of distance.

# Euclidean Space
Ancient Greek geometers introduced Euliciean space for modeling the physical universe. The goal was to prove that all properties of the space as theorems by starting from a few fundamental properties (such as the example of there is exactly one straight line passing through two points). Later this was redefined via vector space and linear algebra which has been shown to be the equivalent asxiomatic definition. 

## Definition
Essentially the Euclidean plane is a set of points satisfying certain relationships, expressible in terms of distance and angles. As an example, there are two fundamential operations (otherwise called as motions) on a plane. One is translation and the other rotation about a fixed point in which all the points in the plane turn about that fixed point through the same angle.

### Technical Definition
A Euclidean vector space is a finite-dimensional inner product space over the real numbers. The dimension of a Euclidean space is the dimension of its associated vector space.

If E is a Euclidean space, its assoicated vector space is also called its space of translations, and ofted denoted as $\overrightarrow E$
