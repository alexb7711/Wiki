## Program Policy/Guidelines
* If the projected degree plan is over $50'000, the student must first pay their portion of the amount exceeding the cap before TA funds can be used.
* TA funds may be used to pay for 100% of tuition and only those fees that are directly related to the instruction of the course. Books, course materials, and miscellaneous fees such as parking, athletic, student advisement, facility, health, or any other miscellaneous fees are at the students expense.
