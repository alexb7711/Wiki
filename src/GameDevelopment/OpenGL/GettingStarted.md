# Getting Started With OpenGL (Open Graphics Library)
Is a cross-language, cross-platform API for rendering 2D and 3D Vector Graphics (use of polygons to represent images). OpenGL API is designed mostly in hardware.

* **Design**: The API is designed as a set of functions which may be called by the client program. The basis is in C, but it has API for other languages.
* **Development**: It is an evolving API and the Khronos Group regularly releases new versions having some extended feature compared to the previous one.
* **Associated Libraries**: The earliest version is released with a companion library called OpenGL utility library. This has since been superseded by free glut.
* **Implementation**: Mesa 3D is an open source implementation of OpenGL.
