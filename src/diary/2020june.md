# May Retrospective
## What Went Well
* Learning a lot with DOS and dad's old computer
* Learning a lot with the books I am reading

## What Didn't Go Well
* Being forgetful lately about things that need to be done too often
* Not a lot of patience
* Sleep has been not the best
* Forgot to email registrar's office

## What To Work On
* Check and update journal more often (at least once daily outside of work)
